# Getting Started

This repository is designed with tight VSCode integration to automate dependency and prerequisites as much as possible using Dev Container ([containers.dev](https://containers.dev/)) to prepare your local VSCode environment for development, or even just run in [Github CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).



# Release

1. Push a tag to this repo in the format "v0.0.0" to initiate a release

1. IMPORTANT: also add a tag in the format "sdk/v0.0.0" for the Go SDK
